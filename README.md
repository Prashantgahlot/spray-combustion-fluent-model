# Spray Combustion Simulation â€“ Pintle Injector Model

This repository contains the numerical setup, simulation notes, and post-processing results for a pintle injector-based combustion system, originally developed as part of my Bachelorâ€™s thesis and later presented at ILASS-America 2021.

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate spray atomization, droplet breakup, and combustion in a coaxial pintle injector configuration using ANSYS Fluent and thermochemical data from NASA CEA. The work models primary breakup physics and flame stabilization characteristics under green propellant conditions.

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Thermochemical properties calculated using NASA CEA
  - Geometry and mesh setup in ANSYS Meshing

- **Solver Setup:**
  - Turbulence: Realizable k-Îµ
  - Combustion: Species Transport + Finite Rate/Eddy Dissipation
  - Spray breakup: DPM with Wave and Taylor Analogy Breakup models
  - Radiation model: P1 (optional)
  
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - Inlet: Fuel/Oxidizer spray input with defined droplet distributions
  - Outlet: Pressure-outlet boundary

## ðŸ“Š Results (Planned Uploads)

- Velocity vector fields  
- Temperature contour plots  
- Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) analysis  
- Pressure and flame front distribution

ðŸ“Œ *Visuals and result images will be uploaded to `/results` folder soon.*

## ðŸ§  Future Directions

- Coupling with OpenFOAM-based models for transient multiphase simulations  
- Development of surrogate models using regression & ML tools (TensorFlow)  
- Parameter sweep and optimization studies for injector design
